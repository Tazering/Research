A quantitative approach for the comparison of additive local explanation methods

Datasets
- Constraints
	- at most 13 features
	- at most 10,000 instances
	- classification tasks

Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forests
Gradient Boosted Machines

Metrics
- Mean Computation Time Per Instance
- Quantification of average deviation of the influence
- Area under Cumulative Feature Importance Curve
- Robustness
- Readability
- Clusterability


Methodology
1. Get all datasets that match criteria
2. Run the XAI Algorithm on all datasets
3. Run the Swarm XAI Algorithm on all the datasets
4. Use the 6 metrics
